# MNIST_Keras

## Description
This is the MNIST dataset implemented in CNN. The MNIST dataset can predict handwritten (drawn) digits from an image and outputs a prediction from 0-9. The model was built with Keras.

To test this model you can open the MNIST_Keras and run it on your device. To test further images just add them to the project and replace my testing with yours.

An example of a handdrawn digit would look like this: Digit 4

Be aware that your images have to have a black background and white line color!

Furthermore your images resolution has to be 28x28px. The line width has to be thick enough to be recognized as a digit.

This CNN model achieves up to 98.7% of accuracy and the structure is as follows:
